<p>Carl Boettiger is an Assistant Professor in the Department of
<a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental Science, Policy and
Management</a> at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC
Berkeley</a>. Carl works on problems in
ecological forecasting and decision making under uncertainty, with
applications for global change, conservation and natural resource
management. Carl is particularly interested in how we can predict or
manage ecological systems that may experience regime shifts: sudden and
dramatic changes that challenge both our models and available data. The
rapid expansion in both computational power and the available ecological
and environmental data enables and requires new mathematical,
statistical and computational approaches to these questions. Ecology has
much to learn about what are and are not useful from advances in
informatics &amp; computer science, just as it has from statistics and
mathematics. Traditional approaches to ecological modeling and resource
management such as stochastic dynamic systems, Bayesian inference, and
optimal control theory must be adapted both to take advantage of all
available data while also dealing with its imperfections. Carl&rsquo;s
approach blends ecological theory with the synthesis of heterogeneous
data and the development of software &ndash; a combination now recognized as
data science.</p>
<p>Carl is a co-founder of the <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci

<p>Paolo D&rsquo;Odorico is a Professor in the Department of <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental
Science, Policy and Management</a> at
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. His research focuses on the
role of hydrological processes in the functioning of terrestrial
ecosystems. Through the analysis of the soil water balance he has
highlighted important nonlinearities in the coupling between soil
moisture dynamics and plant water stress, biogeochemical cycling,
land-atmosphere interactions, plant community composition, and soil
susceptibility to wind erosion. Using field observations and
process-based models, Paolo is investigating new mechanisms of
desertification and factors contributing to the resilience of the desert
margins. His group's work has highlighted the role played by positive
feedbacks with the physical environment on the resilience of savannas,
dry tropical forests, desert shurblands, freshwater wetlands, mangrove
swamps, and seagrass meadows. His work has also shown how environmental
noise may increase the complexity of ecosystem dynamics by inducing new
states, bifurcations, or pattern formation. Paolo is currently
investigating the globalization of water through virtual water trade and
international land investments, and its impact on water equity, societal
resilience, environmental stewardship, and food security.</p>

<p>Sandrine Dudoit is Professor and Chair of the Department of Statistics
and Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, School of Public, at the
University of California, Berkeley. Professor Dudoit's methodological
research interests regard high-dimensional inference and include
exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, loss-based estimation
with cross-validation (e.g., density estimation, classification,
regression, model selection), and multiple hypothesis testing. Much of
her methodological work is motivated by statistical inference questions
arising in biological research and, in particular, the design and
analysis of high-throughput microarray and sequencing gene expression
experiments, e.g., single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) for
discovering novel cell types and for the study of stem cell
differentiation. Her contributions include: exploratory data analysis,
normalization and expression quantitation, differential expression
analysis, class discovery, prediction, inference of cell lineages,
integration of biological annotation metadata (e.g., Gene Ontology (GO)
annotation). She is also interested in statistical computing and, in
particular, reproducible research. She is a founding core developer of
the Bioconductor Project (<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</a>), an open-source
and open-development software project for the analysis of biomedical and
genomic data.</p>
<p>Professor Dudoit is a co-author of the book <em>Multiple Testing Procedures
with Applications to Genomics</em> and a co-editor of the book
<em>Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and
Bioconductor</em>. She is Associate Editor of three journals, including <em>The
Annals of Applied Statistics</em> and <em>IEEE/ACM Transactions on
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</em>. Professor Dudoit was named
Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2010, Elected Member
of the International Statistical Institute in 2014, and Fellow of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 2021.</p>
<p>Professor Dudoit obtained a Bachelor's degree (1992) and a Master's
degree (1994) in Mathematics from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada.
She first came to UC Berkeley as a graduate student and earned a PhD
degree in 1999 from the Department of Statistics. Her doctoral research,
under the supervision of Professor Terence P. Speed, concerned the
linkage analysis of complex human traits. From 1999 to 2000, she was a
postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute,
Berkeley. Before joining the Faculty at UC Berkeley in July 2001, she
underwent two years of postdoctoral training in genomics in the
laboratory of Professor Patrick O. Brown, Department of Biochemistry,
Stanford University. Her work in the Brown Lab involved the development
and application of statistical methods and software for the analysis of
microarray gene expression data.</p>
