        <h2 class="card-title">Mission</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: auto; font-size: 18px"> The Schmidt Center for Data Science and the Environment (DS4E) is a new partnership between
        UC Berkeley's Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at Rausser College
        of Natural Resources and the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society.
        The Center will combine the power of computing and environmental science with open science
        principles and a commitment to inclusivity - all towards the purpose of building tangible,
        replicable, and accessible solutions to problems compromising the health of our environment.
        Researchers in the Center will co-create these solutions in direct partnership with those
        who hold the knowledge and expertise of their local needs and environmental context.
